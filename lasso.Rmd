# understanding how LASSO regression works

This is a simple example of how the lasso regression model works. It uses a built in data set with the R package, mtcars. You can get details about this data set by typing help(“mtcars”) or you can find it on the web at

```{r run_preliminary_commands}
save.image("backup.RData")
rm(list=ls())
```

```{r review_of_mtcars_data}
head(mtcars)
```

```{r save_everything}
save.image("lasso.RData")
load("backup.RData")
